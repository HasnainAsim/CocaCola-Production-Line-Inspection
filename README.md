# CocaCola-Production-Line-Inspection
Visual Inspection Of Products
Background
The most common use of image processing in an industrial setting is for the automated visual
inspection of products leaving a production facility. Automated inspection is used to inspect
everything from pharmaceutical drugs to textile production. It is estimated that the majority of
products bought on supermarket shelves are inspected using automated “machine vision” based
systems prior to dispatch. Why? - To avoid the cost of shipping a faulty or sub-standard item to a
supermarket shelf that no one wants to buy!
In this practical exercise, we are dealing with a bottling production line in a facility bottling CocaCola for the domestic market. We have a set of images, taken under near constant factory lighting
conditions, of the bottles as they leave the bottling line. The bottling company require a vision
system to automatically identify a number of different faults that may occur during filling, labelling
and capping stages of production so that these bottles can be intercepted prior to packaging.
Your task is to design and prototype a image processing system to detect the set of fault conditions
that may occur together with identifying the type of fault that has occurred. You will develop this
prototype system using Matlab and the techniques discussed in the book.
Task Specification – Automated Visual Inspection
You are required to develop a visual inspection system that correctly identifies each of the following
fault conditions that may occur in the bottling plant:
1. bottle under-filled or not filled at all
2. bottle over-filled
3. bottle has label missing
4. bottle has label but label printing has failed (i.e. label is white)
5. bottle label is not straight
6. bottle cap is missing
7. bottle is deformed (i.e. squashed) in some way
In each image, we are only interested in classifying the central bottle in the image. One image is
taken for each bottle leaving the production line so faults occurring in bottles at the sides will be
detected separately when these particular bottles are themselves photographed central to the
image. Additionally, some images may have no bottle in the center of the image – this is not a fault,
just a gap in the production flow stemming from a machine operating further up the line. Faults with
side bottles and missing bottles must be ignored by your system – only the seven faults above must
be reported. You can tackle each of the cases in any order you wish.
Some examples will contain more than one fault with the central bottle but these cases are rare –
identify as many as you can.
